## Why does Sorbet think this is `nil`? I just checked that it's not!

Sorbet implements a [flow-sensitive](flow-sensitive.md) type system, but there
are some [limitations](flow-sensitive.md#limitations-of-flow-sensitivity). In
particular, Sorbet does not assume a method called twice returns the same thing
each time!

See
[Limitations of flow-sensitivity](flow-sensitive.md#limitations-of-flow-sensitivity)
for a fully working example.

## What's the difference between `T.let`, `T.cast`, and `T.unsafe`?

[→ Type Assertions](type-assertions.md)

## What's the type signature for a method with no return?

```ruby
sig {void}
```

[→ Method Signatures](sigs.md)

## What's the difference between `Array` and `T::Array[…]`?

`Array` is the built-in Ruby class for arrays. On the other hand,
`T::Array[...]` is a Sorbet generic type for arrays. The `...` must always be
filled in when using it.

While Sorbet implicitly treats `Array` the same as `T::Array[T.untyped]`, Sorbet
will error when trying to use `T::Array` as a standalone type.

## How do I accept a class object, and not an instance of a class?

[→ T.class_of](class-of.md)

## How do I write a signature for `initialize`?

When defining `initialize` for a class, we strongly encourage that you use
`.void`. This reminds people instantiating your class that they probably meant
to call `.new`, which is defined on every Ruby class. Typing the result as
`.void` means that it's not possible to do anything with the result of
`initialize`.

## How do I override `==`? What signature should I use?

Your method should accept `BasicObject` and return `T::Boolean`.

Unfortunately, not all `BasicObject`s have `is_a?`, so we have to do one extra
step in our `==` function: check whether `Object === other`. (In Ruby, `==` and
`===` are completely unrelated. The latter has to do with [case subsumption]).
The idiomatic way to write `Object === other` in Ruby is to use `case`:

```ruby
case other
when Object
  # ...
end
```

[case subsumption]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3422223/vs-in-ruby

Here's a complete example that uses `case` to implement `==`:

## I use `T.must` a lot with arrays and hashes. Is there a way around this?

`Hash#[]` and `Array#[]` return a [nilable type](nilable-types.md) because in
Ruby, accessing a Hash or Array returns `nil` if the key does not exist or is
out-of-bounds. If you would rather raise an exception than handle `nil`, use the
`#fetch` method:

```ruby
[0, 1, 2].fetch(3) # IndexError: index 3 outside of array bounds
```

## How do I upgrade Sorbet?

Sorbet has not reached version 1.0 yet. As such, it will make breaking changes
constantly, without warning.

To upgrade a patch level (e.g., from 0.4.4314 to 0.4.4358):

```
bundle update sorbet sorbet-runtime
# also update plugins like sorbet-rails, if any
bundle exec srb init

# For plugins like sorbet-rails, see their docs, eg.
https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sorbet-rails#initial-setup

# Optional: Suggest new, stronger sigils (per-file strictness
# levels) when possible. Currently, the suggestion process is
# fallible, and may suggest downgrading when it's not necessary.
bundle exec srb rbi suggest-typed
```

## What platforms does Sorbet support?

The `sorbet` and `sorbet-runtime` gems are currently only tested on Ruby 2.4. We
expect it to work on Ruby 2.3 through 2.6.

The static check is only tested on macOS 10.14 (Mojave) and Ubuntu 18 (Bionic
Beaver). We expect it to work on macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and most Linux
distributions. We use static linking on both platforms, so it should not depend
on system libraries.

There is currently no Windows support.

## Does Sorbet support ActiveRecord (and Rails?)

[sorbet-rails] is a community-maintained project which can help generate RBI
files for certain Rails constructs.

Also see the [Community] page for more community-maintained projects!

## Can I convert from YARD docs to Sorbet signatures?

[Sord] is a community-maintained project which can generate Sorbet RBI files
from YARD docs.

## Can Sorbet produce statistics?

Yes, you can use options like `--metrics-file` to produce statistics. For
example, check out
[sorbet-progress](https://github.com/jaredbeck/sorbet-progress) which uses those
statistics to keep track of your progress adopting sorbet in big codebases.
